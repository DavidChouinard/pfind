Part one
==================

  Name: chown (-R option)
  Sample: chown -R root test/
  Description: Changes the owner (or group ownership) of files

  Name: chgrp (-R option)
  Sample: chgrp root -R test/
  Description: Changes the group ownership of files (note that chown also
    supports this functionality)

  Name: diff (-r option)
  Sample: diff -r dir1/ dir2/
  Description: Shows the line-by-line differences in files.

Part two
==================

See attached code. Compile it by running:

  make pfind

Its usage is as follows:

  pfind starting_dir [-name filename-or-pattern] [-type {f|d|b|c|p|l|s}]

(full usage instructions can be retrieved by running pfind with no argument)

Part three
==================

To deal with directories of arbitrary depth, we could call readdir repeatedly
and append the result to linked list. Once we reach the end of the directory,
we would immediately close the directory and iterating over the linked list to
retrieve the nested files.
